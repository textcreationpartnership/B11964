            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y moÅ¿t deere and louing friends, if the times were Å¿uch (as when it Å¿hall pleaÅ¿e God they may be) I would much rather chooÅ¿e to haue a poore Vicarage, where I might preach the truth amongÅ¿t you, then a rich preferment in any part of the world beÅ¿ides, where I might not enioy your company and friendÅ¿hip. But Å¿eeing it is otherwiÅ¿e, I will lay the fault vpon no body; but rather haue compaÅ¿Å¿ion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, for Å¿uch is the violence of the Å¿treame, that no one man, no not the MaÅ¿ter of the Å¿hip himÅ¿elfe, is able to Å¿tirre the Å¿hip out of the Å¿treame: and yet the courÅ¿e that is held, is certainely very dangerous; not onely for all the paÅ¿Å¿engers that are therin, but euen for the whole veÅ¿Å¿el wherin they are carried. If the loÅ¿Å¿e of me might haue helped it, I had beene happily beÅ¿towed at home: but Å¿eeing that my preÅ¿ence did nothing but procure great danger to my Å¿elfe euery way, and great anger to them, whoÅ¿e game I Å¿eemed to marre as a Å¿tander by: I thought it the Å¿ureÅ¿t way to Å¿aue my Å¿elfe, and to becken to as many of my friends as may pleaÅ¿e to beleeue me; that they would alÅ¿o looke well about them, loÅ¿t they be ouertaken with death, as with a Å¿torme, that in Å¿uch Å¿ommer times doth often come, when it is leaÅ¿t looked for; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againÅ¿t all aduentures to conuey themÅ¿elues into a Å¿urer Å¿hip. I do not deÅ¿ire they Å¿hould follow me, and leaue their lands and liuings, their friends and Countrie, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of their deare and dread Soueraigne: (and yet if there be no remedie, for the honor of ChriÅ¿t and his truth, all muÅ¿t be forÅ¿aken:) much leÅ¿Å¿e doe I allow, that any man Å¿hould withdraw his allegiance and true Å¿eruice from King IAMES, and to beÅ¿tow it vpon any other Prince, or Prelate in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177554:3"/> world. Only for the dutie I owe vnto God, who hath called me to the knowledge of his truth, and the loue I beare vnto my Countrie, and to all my friends that are therein, I doe moÅ¿t humbly and hartily deÅ¿ire them, that they would Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly conÅ¿ider and looke to the Å¿tate of their Å¿oules, which being immortall, cannot be Å¿aued by any Å¿uch religion, as is temporall, mutable, and diÅ¿Å¿onant in it Å¿elfe: And Å¿eeing no man can be Å¿aued that dieth out of charitie with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (for that an vncharitable Å¿oule cannot be altered, and made charitable after it is departed.) Let euery good Å¿oule take heed, how by the railing Å¿landers of ignorant, malicious and proud men, it be brought and held out of charitie with a whole Church, and eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch a Church as cannot bee deemed to be the mother of that Church, that is in England; and being a mother Church, it is worthy at leaÅ¿t to be heard quietly to tell out her tale at length, before Å¿he be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the outcries of thoÅ¿e that either of malice, or of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome, doe raile vpon her: which I write not that I would haue the Church of Rome gaine by the goods of England, for I know Å¿he intends it not, and the State may prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t; but that I deÅ¿ire the Å¿oules of England Å¿hould gaine by the Church of Rome, which if you might freely heare her Å¿peake, you would certainely deÅ¿ire alÅ¿o. And although Å¿he may not be Å¿uffered to Å¿peake to you, yet you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of her: and heare what indifferent men without choler or paÅ¿Å¿ion doe Å¿ay and write of her. And if you doe find her indeed to be the true Mother, Å¿uffer not the Diuell to poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e your vnderÅ¿tanding by hereÅ¿ie, nor your wills by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for any worldly reÅ¿pect whatÅ¿oeuer; but vnite your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding to the vnderÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding of the Church by faith, and your affections to the wil of the Church, by loue &amp; charitie: and if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible, vnite your outward man alÅ¿o to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, by the participation of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, and by al Å¿piritual obedience. But if you finde impoÅ¿Å¿ibilitie therein, then hauing done your beÅ¿t to helpe the Catholike Church by your faith &amp; charitie; as S. AVGVSTINE exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

Call vpon ChriÅ¿t, who is the immortall PrieÅ¿t and BiÅ¿hop of your Å¿oules, that hee would vouchÅ¿afe by his abÅ¿olute power to Å¿upply the want of his owne ordinance, and to doe that by himÅ¿elfe without Sacraments, which you vnfainedly would, but cannot haue done by any PrieÅ¿t of his Å¿ending, and by the Sacraments that he hath appointed: And there is hope that he will doe it, as Saint BERNARD writeth in his booke <hi>de Anima.</hi> This was the CourÅ¿e I tooke, vntill God gaue me oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to take a better; for which I humbly thanke his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly MaieÅ¿tie, and am deÅ¿irous to giue all good men Å¿atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that haue any religion at all. But I doe conÅ¿ider that there are, as you may eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee amongÅ¿t your Å¿elues, foure Å¿orts of ChriÅ¿tians in the world out of the Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Some doe not beleeue either hell or heauen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are content to goe to any Church, and be of any religion; but care for none at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Some do beleeue that there is hell and heauen; but that all things fall out by abÅ¿olute predeÅ¿tination, as by fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tiny, and therefore there is no Church, nor religion can doe a man good, but only to reade Scriptures and heare Sermons and to beleeue that a man is predeÅ¿tinate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Some doe beleeue there is hell and heauen, and that Some religion is neceÅ¿Å¿arie; but it is no great matter what; Å¿o a man obey the Kings Lawes, and liue like an honeÅ¿t man. For, they Å¿ay, euery man may be Å¿aued in his owne religion. All theÅ¿e I am out of hope to Å¿atisfie, although their follies be againÅ¿t the light of naturall reaÅ¿on, but they haue loÅ¿t reaÅ¿on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Some there are that beleeue there is hell and heauen, and that there is no way to auoide the one, or attaine the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only true ChriÅ¿tian Religion, which they would gladly embrace, if they could know which it were. To them, and for their Å¿akes, I would take any paines to giue Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And I am certaine, if they will heare mee with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they will be Å¿atisfied.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:177554:4"/>
                  <p>And for the ground of this queÅ¿tion; I thinke it will bee granted on all Å¿ides, that, that only is the true ChriÅ¿tian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t did teach himÅ¿elfe when he was vpon the earth, and which, as he promiÅ¿ed, Å¿hall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vntill he come againe.</p>
                  <p>Then the maine care is, to find what religion our Sauiour taught whileÅ¿t he was vpon the earth. And heere I would pray euery man of reaÅ¿on to conÅ¿ider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That our Sauiour did leaue nothing in writing, but taught his Religion to his ApoÅ¿tles by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That he commanded not his ApoÅ¿tles to write his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to teach it, <hi>ite praedicate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That of twelue ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿euen did leaue nothing at all in writing, but taught their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors the Religion of ChriÅ¿t by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That Saint MARKE, Saint LVKE, and Saint PAVL, who wrote moÅ¿t of the new TeÅ¿tament, were not of ChriÅ¿t his company whileÅ¿t he was vpon the earth, and therefore muÅ¿t needs learne their Religion of the Church, before they wrote it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 That diuers others did write the Religion of ChriÅ¿t, as they did apprehend it, but their GoÅ¿pels and EpiÅ¿tles were reiected by the Church, LVKE 1. 1.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That at the day of Iudgement, there will be no writing to trie true Religion from HereÅ¿ie, but only the eternall truth of ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿oules of his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 That the Scriptures were written by men of the Church; admitted Canonicall by Councels of the Church; preÅ¿erued from Tyrants by the care of the Church, and euer, vntill of late, expounded by the conÅ¿ent of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 How few men are able to reade and expound the Scriptures any way, and whether it be not eaÅ¿ier to beleeue the Church, then to beleeue a few priuate men, that Å¿ay they can expound Scriptures better then the Church.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That all Å¿orts of Heretikes haue alwaies boaÅ¿ted of Scriptures, and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:177554:4"/>
                  <p>The Heretikes haue euer beene wont to pretend Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the more eaÅ¿ily to deceiue the Å¿imple.

                  <p>Now to know which is the true Church our Sauiour did found, we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue that this word Church doth Å¿ignifie diuers things.</p>

                  <p>ConÅ¿ider then, deare friends, what a happy thing it is for a man to liue in Å¿uch a Church, that is, with Å¿uch a Clergie, as being lawfully called, and continuing in the vnity of the Church, haue the very Å¿ame power that the ApoÅ¿tles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues; yea that ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, as he was Man, had to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue Å¿innes vnto the penitent; to conuey grace by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ChriÅ¿t conueyed it himÅ¿elfe Å¿ometime without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to exhibite the Reall preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t vnto the faithfull, and to preach the glad tidings of Å¿aluation both by word and writing. And on the contrary Å¿ide, what an vnÅ¿peakable miÅ¿ery it is to haue Å¿uch a Clergie, that is, Å¿uch a Church as hath no calling but from a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill MagiÅ¿trate, and conÅ¿equently no power from ChriÅ¿t, no remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, no grace in Sacraments, no Reall preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t amongÅ¿t them, nor warrant from ChriÅ¿t either to preach or expound the Scriptures; although they talke of them neuer Å¿o much. I will not determine againÅ¿t the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Clergie in England, becauÅ¿e it is to me very doubtfull; but although the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ions were neuer Å¿o good, if there be not vnitie, there can be no grace conueyed from the head vnto Å¿uch parts of the body as are by SchiÅ¿me cut off, and with hoÅ¿tilitie oppoÅ¿ed; as you Å¿ee moÅ¿t of the Clergie of England to be. WhileÅ¿t my Å¿elfe was amongÅ¿t you, I did what I could to reduce vnity, and to withÅ¿tand SchiÅ¿me, and therefore I hope God hath conueyed Å¿ome grace by my MiniÅ¿trie amongÅ¿t you; but if you conÅ¿ider du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the premiÅ¿Å¿es, you cannot condemne me for taking a Å¿urer courÅ¿e for my Å¿elfe, eÅ¿pecially Å¿eeing you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how much I was maligned, and oppoÅ¿ed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters and maintainers of SchiÅ¿me. It is a continuall griefe to me, that I cannot preach vnto you: And I pray God Å¿o moue the hearts of his MaieÅ¿tie and the Parliament, that it may not be treaÅ¿on, nor felonie to be a Catholike PrieÅ¿t, nor to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Saint PETER. nor to preach Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as it is held in the Church of Rome, according to all antiquitie, with one vniuerÅ¿all conÅ¿ent.

But behold the puniÅ¿hment of this Tyrant: It pleaÅ¿ed God that Gaynas being alienated from Arcadius, for his Å¿o much fauouring and aduancing this EVTROPIVS, as all in furie and rage, he made warre againÅ¿t the Emperour and brought him to this, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was glad to admit what conditions of peace Gaynas would offer.

Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on EVTROPIVS was depriued of all his places, dignities and riches, which were exceeding great: and Å¿o perceiuing his miÅ¿ery, fled to the Church, layeth hold vpon Sanctuarie, and was for that time protected by Saint ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome, who Å¿tood in the defence of the priuiledges of the Church, and would not permit the Å¿ouldiers to take him from the Altar, before he had cauÅ¿ed the Emperour to Å¿weare neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him into the hands of Gaynas, nor to put him to death. And although he had beene a great enemy of Saint ChryÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome, and all the people cried to haue him made away. Yet Saint ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome, in regard of the priuiledge, would not condeÅ¿cend, but with an eloquent oration diÅ¿Å¿wadeth the people, and laboureth to Å¿aue him. So as it is to be noted, he that oppoÅ¿ed himÅ¿elfe againÅ¿t this holy BiÅ¿hop, and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, had no other refuge, then to the Å¿ame. Finally, being depriued of Å¿o many dignities, honors and riches, his name aboliÅ¿hed, his Å¿tatuaes, enÅ¿ignes and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all, both publike and priuate places defaced, he was baniÅ¿hed into Cyprus; from whence at the inÅ¿tance of Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he was Å¿ent for, and beheaded.

                     <p>If then, as I Å¿aid before, Catholikes doe not weigh theÅ¿e things, but for feare of temporall loÅ¿Å¿es, or diÅ¿commoditie, fall out of this Church, God almightie will call vnto him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are yet Å¿educed and blinded with hereÅ¿ie and Å¿inne.

The CroÅ¿Å¿e is the moÅ¿t precious Iewell of our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t: and of this Iewell he alwaies giueth the greateÅ¿t portions to his deareÅ¿t friends. Let vs therefore amids our greateÅ¿t croÅ¿Å¿es and tribulations be of good comfort; there is no better Å¿igne of our election and predeÅ¿tination, then (liuing in Gods grace and fauour, and keeping our Å¿elues in the vnity and obedience of our holy Mother the Catholike Church) to be diuers wayes afflicted and perÅ¿ecuted, to be robbed and Å¿poiled, belied and Å¿lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the enemies of Gods eternall truth. Let vs not Å¿uffer for theft, for murther, for other criminall matters, but if it be for Catholike religion, for obedience to our lawfull PaÅ¿tors, and Å¿pirituall guides, which doe watch ouer vs, as bound to render an account for our Å¿oules, according to the ApoÅ¿tle, Hebr. 13. 17. <hi>Obedite praepoÅ¿itis veÅ¿tris, &amp;c.</hi> Let vs not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed, but eÅ¿teeme our Å¿elues euen bleÅ¿Å¿ed in this life, as our Sauiour pronounceth of vs. And the more we Å¿hall Å¿uffer for Å¿o glorious a cauÅ¿e, Å¿o much more happy we Å¿hall be: for there is no proportion betwixt our preÅ¿ent Å¿ufferings, and the future rewards. <hi>Non Å¿unt condigne paÅ¿siones huius temporis ad futuram gloriam.</hi> The paÅ¿Å¿ions of this time are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne to the glory to come, that Å¿hall be reuealed in vs. Rom. 8. 18. Let vs then reioyce in tribulation, and nothing doubt but that our mercifull Lord who Å¿ends it, will likewiÅ¿e Å¿end comfort with it. 2. Cor. 17. <hi>Sicut Å¿ocij eÅ¿t is paÅ¿sionum, Å¿ic eritis &amp; conÅ¿olationis in ChriÅ¿to IeÅ¿u Domino noÅ¿tro.</hi> As you are fellowes of his paÅ¿Å¿ions, Å¿o alÅ¿o Å¿hall you be of conÅ¿olation in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, &amp;c.

Cor. 1. 5. To make an end, let vs reioyce in tribulation, at leaÅ¿t eÅ¿teeme it all joy when we fall into diuers temptations, as exhorteth bleÅ¿Å¿ed Saint Iames, chap. 1. 2. But if wee doe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177554:19"/> finde in our Å¿elues this imperfection, that we cannot reioyce in croÅ¿Å¿es and troubles, neither yet haue that high eÅ¿teeme of it, as we ought, at leaÅ¿t let vs diÅ¿poÅ¿e our Å¿elues to patience, for Å¿uch as loÅ¿e patience, as out of feare fall away: the Angel, or rather our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith in the Apocalyps, Their part Å¿hall be in the burning lake, Apocal. 31. 8. And that which may moÅ¿t encourage vs, is that comfortable aÅ¿Å¿ertion of our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, often repeated in the Apocalyps, <hi>Qui vicerit dabo ei edere Mannae abÅ¿c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This which hath been Å¿aid may not only be of great force to confirme the obedient, and reÅ¿olute children of Gods Church, but alÅ¿o may auaile much to confound Å¿uch as liue in SchiÅ¿me, and participate with Heretikes in their execrable Å¿eruice and Sacraments, contrary to their conÅ¿ciences. Whom, beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e former points, I beÅ¿eech in the bowels of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, to reflect vpon the vncertainty of this life, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of all earthly things; vpon Gods Å¿euere judgements executed vpon rebellious and Å¿chiÅ¿maticall people; vpon the foure laÅ¿t things, to wit, Death, Iudgement, Heauen and Hell: vpon the conÅ¿tancie of innumerable moÅ¿t glorious Martyrs of either Å¿exe, &amp;c. And they cannot, conÅ¿idering theÅ¿e things with Å¿erious attention, they cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly (I Å¿ay) continue longer in SchiÅ¿me, but with all Å¿peed recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themÅ¿elues to almightie God and his Church. And that this (I Å¿ay) may take better effect with them. I will conclude with thoÅ¿e two excellent Å¿ayings of Saint AuguÅ¿tine, moÅ¿t worthy to be noted.</p>

And is not this that the Prophet IÅ¿ay, or rather God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by the Prophet threatneth, IÅ¿ai. 60. 12. <hi>Gens, &amp; Regnum quod non Å¿eruierit tibi peribit,</hi> The Nation &amp; Kingdom which will not Å¿erue thee Å¿hall periÅ¿h: that is, Å¿uch Kingdomes and People as will not Å¿ubject themÅ¿elues to the yoke of ChriÅ¿t, and obedience of his Church, Å¿hall periÅ¿h. Were not the moÅ¿t flouriÅ¿hing parts of the world for their fall to Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿me, DonatiÅ¿me, NeÅ¿torianiÅ¿me, and other condemned hereÅ¿ies, for a juÅ¿t puniÅ¿hment of God ouer-runne and brought to deÅ¿olation by the Sarazens, and by infinite bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Å¿auage people, Gothes, Vandals, Hunnes, Alanes, and others?</p>
                     <p>All HiÅ¿tories are full of theÅ¿e matters, expreÅ¿Å¿ely Å¿etting downe the cauÅ¿e of the ouerthrow of Å¿o many goodly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177554:21"/> in AÅ¿ia, but eÅ¿pecially Africa; and in Europe, as Italy, Spaine, France, Germany, England, with other more.</p>
                     <p>Were not theÅ¿e goodly parts of the world, neere about vs, together with al Africa, ouerrun and deÅ¿troyed by the Goths, Vandals, and other barbarous people, for SchiÅ¿me and Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie? Were not the Britons in this Iland, after they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with the HereÅ¿ie of Pelagius, thruÅ¿t out of their Å¿eates, moÅ¿t of them deÅ¿troyed, and the remnant driuen into the barrenneÅ¿t parts of the Iland by the Saxons? And I Å¿hould neuer make an end, if I Å¿hould proceed to bring Å¿o many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances in this point, as are recorded in all Å¿orts of Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and writings extant in the world.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs relate Å¿ome few examples of Å¿o many of the temporall proÅ¿peritie, and happy Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿uch Princes as adhered to the Church, honored and defended it.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, thoÅ¿e noble victories are well knowne which are recorded in the old TeÅ¿tament, as the victories of Abraham, MoÅ¿es, IoÅ¿ua, Gedeon, Samuel, Dauid, Ezechias, IoÅ¿ias, and the Machabees.</p>
                     <p>In the new TeÅ¿tament, that is, in the Law of Grace, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantine the Great, which firÅ¿t of all the Emperours publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended the Church, almoÅ¿t in like Å¿ort vanquiÅ¿hed Maxentius, as MoÅ¿es did Pharao; for Maxentius was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Tyber, as Pharao in the Red-Å¿ea. EuÅ¿eb. lib. 9. hiÅ¿t. cap. 9. Of him Å¿peaketh Saint AuguÅ¿tine, <hi>lib. 5. de Ciuitate Dei, cap.</hi> 25. ConÅ¿tantine the Emperour not Å¿uppliant to Diuels, but worÅ¿hipping the true God, receiued Å¿o many gifts and bleÅ¿Å¿ings from God, as none durÅ¿t preÅ¿ume to wiÅ¿h: this one AuguÅ¿tus held, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed and defended the whole Romane Empire: In adminiÅ¿tring and making warre, hee was moÅ¿t victorious; in vanquiÅ¿hing and repreÅ¿Å¿ing Tyrants, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proÅ¿perous<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> being of great yeares, hee died of Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e and old age, and left Å¿onnes three, Emperours, to Å¿ucceed him.</p>
                     <p>Of THEODOSIVS the elder, in the Å¿ame place writeth the Å¿ame S. AuguÅ¿t. cap. 26. that he had wonderfull Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177554:21"/> in all his affaires, becauÅ¿e he was very pious and Catholike: that in the battels he fought with his enemies, their owne weapons, darts and arrowes, were retorted vpon the authors, God almighty fighting for him. Moreouer, L. Theodoret, in his fift booke of hiÅ¿tory, cap. 24. reporteth that S. Iohn and S. Philip the ApoÅ¿tles, appeared fighting for the Emperour TheodoÅ¿ius in the Å¿ame battell, riding vpon white horÅ¿es.</p>
                     <p>Of HONORIVS alÅ¿o, who was a moÅ¿t Catholike Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and moÅ¿t addicted to the Pope, as in his epiÅ¿tles to Pope Boniface appeareth, as writeth S. Aug. l. 5. de ciuit. Dei, c. 23. that God did Å¿o fight for him, as in one battell he Å¿lew of the Gothes aboue an hundred thouÅ¿and, and did take Radagai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us the King, with his Å¿ons, and put him to death: and (which was moÅ¿t admirable) there was not Å¿o much as one of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie either killed or wounded.</p>
                     <p>Of THEODOSIVS the yonger, writeth Socrat. l. 7. hiÅ¿t. cap. 18. that his armie skirmiÅ¿hing with the Barbarians, and himÅ¿elfe in the meane Å¿pace making his prayers vnto God within the city, about an hundred thouÅ¿and of the Sarazens were beaten and driuen by Angels into the riuer Euphrates, and Å¿o periÅ¿hed miÅ¿erably.</p>
                     <p>IVSTINTAN the elder, whileÅ¿t he was Catholike raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moÅ¿t proÅ¿perouÅ¿ly, in Å¿o much as he reÅ¿tored to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire-Italy, Africk and many other Prouinces, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Euagrius l. 4. hiÅ¿t. c. 26. &amp; Å¿equentibus. But after he became an Heretike, and purpoÅ¿ed to Å¿et forth an Edict for receiuing of his hereÅ¿ie, forthwith he died Å¿uddenly, and Å¿o deliuered the Church from great feare, as writeth the Å¿ame Euagrius, lib. 4. cap. vlt.</p>
                     <p>HERACLIVS alÅ¿o, as appeareth in Zonoras, and other HiÅ¿toriographers, whileÅ¿t he was Catholike got a moÅ¿t ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and admirable victory againÅ¿t the PerÅ¿ians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the holy CroÅ¿Å¿e, at which time the Å¿tate of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire was altogether deÅ¿perate; but after he fell into the hereÅ¿ie of the Monothelites, he euer had euil Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing euer Å¿ucceeding with him, and himÅ¿elfe was extinct of a new and Å¿trange diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:177554:22"/>
                     <p>AlÅ¿o it is manifeÅ¿t by the hiÅ¿tories of the Greekes, that the Emperours of the EaÅ¿t, from that time, by reaÅ¿on of the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enÅ¿ion about Images, they diuided themÅ¿elues from the Church of Rome, Å¿till decreaÅ¿ed in power and authority, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laÅ¿t they vtterly loÅ¿t the Empire. And in the WeÅ¿t it is plaine by the hiÅ¿tories of the Latins, that the Emperours did more or leÅ¿Å¿e flouriÅ¿h, as they were more or leÅ¿Å¿e addicted to the Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>In the time of VRBANE the Å¿econd, vnto the yeare of our Lord M. xcviij. the ChriÅ¿tians in that holy war made by the Pope for the recouery of IeruÅ¿alem, when they were in moÅ¿t deÅ¿perate Å¿tate, becauÅ¿e of the approching of an infinite hoÅ¿te of the Turkes and PerÅ¿ians, and they were but a few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wel-neare Å¿terued for lack of food; in Å¿o much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the moÅ¿t valiant and Å¿touteÅ¿t men did goe leaning vpon their Å¿taues, neither had they but a few horÅ¿es, Å¿o as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of them, to wit, Godfrey was forced to borow a horÅ¿e, and many Princes were conÅ¿trained to ride vpon AÅ¿Å¿es: at laÅ¿t God reuealed where was the Launce of ChriÅ¿t, and it being carried before them, gaue victory in the warre, in Å¿o much as there were Å¿laine of the Turks an hundred thouÅ¿and, and Å¿carÅ¿ely foure thouÅ¿and of the ChriÅ¿tians loÅ¿t. And there fell from heauen a dewe vpon them, which comforted and refreÅ¿hed both their bodies and their Å¿oules. Finally, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from heauen three holy men fighting for them. See Paulus Aemilius lib. 4. Guill. Tyr. lib. 6. neare the end, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechimus, which continueth the Å¿tory of Marianus Scotus.</p>
                     <p>In the time of INNOCENTIVS the third, in France, of eight thouÅ¿and Catholikes, were Å¿laine in one battell an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouÅ¿and of the AlbigenÅ¿ian Heretikes, as writeth Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius, lib 6. hiÅ¿t. Francor.</p>
                     <p>In our daies, 1531. the Catholikes of Heluetia fought fiue battels in defence of the Catholike faith, againÅ¿t the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of Heluetia, and in euery one of them the Catholikes got the victory, whereas they were both in number and power farre inferiour to the Heretikes. See Io. Coclaeus in Act. Lutheri. 1531.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:177554:22"/>
                     <p>CHARLES the fift got a victory againÅ¿t the Lutherans, not without a miracle from heauen. Anno 1547.</p>
                     <p>Many other miraculous victories which the Catholikes haue got againÅ¿t Heretikes, both in France and other parts, might hereunto be annexed; but let theÅ¿e Å¿uffice.</p>
